Topic: HTML and CSS

Q1 : How was your Week 1? What did you learn? What did you struggle on?
	It was great. Meeting everyone was fun. I struggled with time management as I had a slight time crunch on the developer project. I learned new css tricks.

Q2 : How much JavaScript do you know? Scale 1 to 10 and explain what you know?
	4/10

Q3: After today’s lesson could you explain one concept of HTML/CSS in detail. (Such as HTML Elements or Linking Pages.)
	It’s best to name html elements accurately rather than making everything divs as the code is more readable and organized.
