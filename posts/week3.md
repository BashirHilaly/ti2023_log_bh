Topic: Databases

Q1: Have you ever worked with databases? If so, describe your experience. If not, what are you looking foward to learning about databases?
Yes, I have done lots of machine learning tests and projects in the past so I dealt with databases to that extent. I also had a database for users in my website I made for the coded by kids website competition. Also I had an internship at comcast where I got to basically remove unnecessary data and format some basic databases.

Q2: What is one concept you learned during todayâ€™s meeting? Try to explain it in detail.
In the second meeting I learned the difference between DDL and DML. DDL is used to define and manage the structure of a database, including creating and modifying database objects such as tables, and indexes. DML is used to manipulate the data within a database, including inserting, updating, and deleting records in tables.

Q3: Can you think of something in your daily life that is or could be modeled using a database? Try to describe how this system might be structured.
Probably tasks that I have to get done. We could have attributes like Name, Importance, Date (date it must get done by), etc
