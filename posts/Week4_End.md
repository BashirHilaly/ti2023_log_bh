Q1: How do you feel about React as a tool for development? Do you plan to continue using it?
I like React and do plan on continuing with it.

Q2: How confident do you feel in creating a complete React app and why?
I feel quite confident in getting a complete React app running but I definetly need more work on things like hooks.

Q3: Break down your approach to building the posts app.
First I made the base app through the terminal. After that I assembled the different components such as the posts component and the create post component. Then I created ways to collect and display the data mainly using the useState() hook. Of course I added some styling with tailwind along the way.

Q4: Consider how you could hypothetically connect your database knowledge to your React apps.
I would most likely connect the database to the express server, and from that server we access our frontend react stuff.
