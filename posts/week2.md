Topic: NodeJS

Question 1: Did you face any problems or difficulties with your backend development tasks this week? If you did, please explain one specific challenge you faced and if you solved it, how so?
	At first I had trouble running the server. I would use node to run the script but localhost would be empty. This was until I realized I have to run the code with nodemon.

Question 2: Out of all the things we learned about Node.js/Express this week, which one interested you the most? (Structure, Postman, API creation, etc) Explain that concept in detail, and tell us why itâ€™s important for backend development.
	I was most interested in the process of getting data and sending it through javascript. GET methods are essentially used for retrieving data while POST sends data along with the request. This is important as we can allow users to view and add to public databases making the user experience more immerseful.

Question 3: Describe the structure of the client and server in the Blog application, and explain how they are connected and work together.
	The server holds information about the logic behind the blog application. It also holds data in its database such as blog posts and more. The client is usually the frontend the user sees and makes requests to the server and depending on the logic could possibly make changes to or add to the database.
