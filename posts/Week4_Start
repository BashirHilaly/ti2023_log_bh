Topic: React

Q1: Before this week, how much do you know about React and reactive frameworks on a scale from 1 to 10, and explain why?
I know what react is but never used it so I would give myself a 2/10.

Q2: Compared to traditional HTML, CSS, and JS served with Express JS, how do you foresee the React method improving your workflow?
It will probably make it more faster in the long run. Also it will make the entire process more modular and easier to build on top of.

Q3: Summarize the individual parts of the Virtual DOM and how they work together.


Q4: How confident do you feel with writing JS code? Please specify the specific parts you require more assistance with.
